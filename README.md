# readers-writers-problem
In this project I implemented the famous in OS: RW problem 

### Main idea

In simple words, the main process (Coordinator) is using the fork() function 'n' times.

Also, we decide how many processes will behave as readers and also how many processes will behave as writers.

### Compile and run

To compile the program,simple type:

```make```

And then to give arguments:

``` ./main [Entries_of_Shared_Memory] [Peers] [RatioRW] ```
